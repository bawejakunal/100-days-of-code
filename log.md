# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practises stacks and queues for problem solving

**Thoughts:** Overthinking is bad ! Easiest solutions are the only solutions one needs most of the times to start with. I need to work hard on concepts of graphs.

**Link to work:** [Queues and Stacks](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/90bb6acb9ac979a07e7ea557e6ee5c44ca0800f3?diff=unified)
