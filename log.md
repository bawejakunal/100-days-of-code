# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Practised stacks and queues for problem solving  
**Thoughts**: Overthinking is bad ! Easiest solutions are the only solutions one needs most of the times to start with. I need to work hard on concepts of graphs.  
**Link to work:** [Queues and Stacks](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/90bb6acb9ac979a07e7ea557e6ee5c44ca0800f3?diff=unified)  
**Time:** 01:35  


### Day 1: June 5th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Implemented AVL-Tree balancing and insertion  
**Thoughts**: Minor hiccups, good learning. Need more clarity of thoughts.  
**Link to work:** [AVL Tree](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/32517c5419ac423f635cbe7fff52b48485448436?diff=unified)  
**Time:** 01:10  

### Day 2: June 6th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Practised stacks and simple string searching

**Time:** 01:05  

### Day 3: June 7th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Solved simple algorithm implementation questions  
**Thoughts**: Good warmup for the brain  
**Link to work:** Pushed with Day 4  
**Time:** 00:20  

### Day 4: June 8th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Continued solving simple algorithm implementation questions  
**Thoughts**: Good warmup for the brain

**Time:** 02:15  

### Day 5: June 9th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Finished Easy section of Implementation problems on Hackerrank    
**Thoughts**: Had a little hiccup, hopefully more practise will help me overcome that  
**Link to work:** [Implementations](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/ecb5d80e7e863fdacfa256646c394dce2ec49aba?diff=unified)  
**Time:** 01:00  

### Day 6: June 10th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Medium difficulty implementations started  
**Thoughts**: Got stuck unnecessarily in Queens-Attack-II problem. Need avoid overthinking  
**Link to work:** [Queens Attack II](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/f4aa00e22415b2a67b3f5a429c030556b72c7e97)  
**Time:** 02:00  


### Day 7: June 11th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Practised two problems for 2D Matrices  
**Thoughts**: Stuck in determining overlapping squares in a matrix. Need more clarity of concepts and edge cases through practise  
**Link to work:** [Containers of Balls](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/0174678bc7cfb51e034d360c82a029e6406e2aa3)  
**Time:** 03:00  

### Day 8: June 12th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: String algorithms practised  
**Thoughts**: Easy job but need more practise for faster implementations and confidence  
**Link to work:** [Strings Practise](https://github.com/bawejakunal/hackerrank/commit/f1763fa3bc3164c842fce7e544b11ac847b430f1)  
**Time:** 01:15  

### Day 9: June 12th, 2017  
**Today's Progress**: Generic string algorithms and caeser cipher implementation  
**Thoughts**: Good practise of basics
